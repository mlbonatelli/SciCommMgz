## Before you start  

Science Communication Magazine (SciCommMgz) is an open project that aimed at empowering scientists in doing science communication in the same time time we produce a good science communication material. Our main goal is to build a strong community of scientists, communicators and enthusiatics to improve science literacy and awareness.
You can read more on our philosophy and aims in our [README](README.md) file, and in our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md).  

## How to work on GitHub  

>*Using this awesome Github instructions from [IGNITE](https://github.com/graciellehigino/IGNITE) :heart:

If you're new to GitHub, take some time to understand how a repository works. Don't worry if you find it difficult, we can always help!  
GitHub has its own [guides](https://guides.github.com/) which are really useful. Basically, you need to know how to [file an Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and how to contribute directly to the core contents of the project by [submitting a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request). Please, be as clear as you can in both cases, describing what is the problem/suggestion/solution in details. Also, be sure that your suggestion/problem/solution was not addressed in another Issue before.
