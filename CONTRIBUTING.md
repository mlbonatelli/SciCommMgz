## Code of Conduct

If you decide to participate in this project, we assume you agree with the [IGNITE Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [mlbonatelli@gmail.com](mailto:mlbonatelli@gmail.com).  

## Before you start  

IGNITE is a project to make a solid, fun and practical workshop aimed at training scientists so that they can understand how they can do SciComm and how they can harmonize that with their research. You can read more on our philosophy and aims in our [README](README.md) file, and in our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md).  
This is a completly open project, and every contribution made to it is also completly open. Keep that in mind, and let's move foward!  

## How to work on GitHub  

If you're new to GitHub, take some time to understand how a repository works. Don't worry if you find it difficult, we can always help!  
GitHub has its own [guides](https://guides.github.com/) which are really useful. Basically, you need to know how to [file an Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and how to contribute directly to the core contents of the project by [submitting a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request). Please, be as clear as you can in both cases, describing what is the problem/suggestion/solution in details. Also, be sure that your suggestion/problem/solution was not addressed in another Issue before.
