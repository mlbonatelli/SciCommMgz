## What are we doing?

The main pressure that undergrad and graduate students suffer in university is for them to publish papers in high impact magazines.

## Who are we?
[Maria][link_https://github.com/mlbonatelli] and [Gacielle][link_graciellehigino] have met each other on Twitter. They are both from Brazil but they live far apart from each other. But since they met, they have realised that they share a commom passion: Science Communication, or as people say online, SciComm.
Now, they are both involved in projects to put SciComm on the map. They want to empower scientists to perform good and interesting SciCom and create places, such as this Magazine, where they can share content about SciComm.

## What do we need?
Soon.
