# SciCommMgz

***Empowering our community through interesting and quality science communication***

## Welcome

Hi! :wave: :wave: :wave:

It's really nice to have you here! :heart: :tada:

The README file will help you to understand more about the SciCommMgz project and how you can get involved!

## What are we doing?

Science is everywhere. From your smartphone to the water that you drink. We need to talk about it. 

Scientists are usually under a lot of pressure to publish papers in high impact magazines. Which is not completly wrong, through these papers scientists can communicate the results from their reseaches to the entire community! I mean scientific community. Scientists - and by that I mean professors, undergrad and graduate students - usually left SciComm aside.

But what if we have a magazine that publishes SciComm papers? That will give the prestige that undergrad and graduate students need for their curriculum and that will have great content about Science that the public can enjoy and understand?

That is our idea. Science Communication Magazine (Please help us find a cooler to our Mgz [here][link_Magazine])

## Who are we?

[Maria][link_mlbonatelli] and [Gacielle][link_graciellehigino] met each other on Twitter. They are both from Brazil but they live far apart from each other - almost a 10 hour drive. But since they met, they have realised that they share a commom passion: Science Communication. Or as people usually say ***SciComm***.

Now, they are both involved in projects to put SciComm on the map. They want to empower scientists to perform good and interesting SciCom (Want to know more that? See [IGNITE][link_ignite]) and create places, such as this Magazine, where they can share content about SciComm.

## What do we need?

We need people that want to know more about science. We need people that know a lot about science. Basically, we need you
