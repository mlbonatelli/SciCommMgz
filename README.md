# SciCommMgz

***Empowering our community through interesting and quality science communication***

## Welcome

Hi! :wave: :wave: :wave:

It's really nice to have you here! :heart: :tada:

The README file will help you to understand more about the SciCommMgz project and how you can get involved!

## What are we doing?

Science is everywhere. From your smartphone to the water that you drink. We need to talk about it. 

Scientists are usually under a lot of pressure to publish papers in high impact magazines. Which is kind of ok, through these papers scientists can communicate the results from their reseaches to the entire community! I mean scientific community. Scientists - and by that I mean professors, undergrad and graduate students - usually don't communicate science to the society.

But what if we have a magazine that publishes scientific papers with a more comprehensible and interesting content? A magazine that, in one hand, will give the prestige that undergrad and graduate students need for their curriculum and, on the other, will have great content about science that the public can enjoy.

Science Communication Magazine (Please help us find a cooler name to our Mgz [here][link_Magazine]) is an open peer-reviewed science magazine that will publish interesting news about science.

## Who are we?

[Maria][link_mlbonatelli] and [Gracielle][link_graciellehigino] met on Twitter. They are both from Brazil but they live far apart from each other - almost a 10 hour drive. But since they met, they have realised that they share a commom passion: Science Communication. Or, as people usually say, ***SciComm***.

Now, they are both involved in projects to put SciComm on the map. They want to empower scientists to perform good and interesting SciComm (want to know more about that? See [IGNITE][link_ignite]) and create places, such as this Magazine, where they can share content about SciComm.

## What do we need?

We need people that want to know more about science. We need people that know a lot about science. Basically, we need you!

We are building this magazine from scratch, so we need help in several different things. We need to think about the writers and reviewers experience and we need to build a magazine that people really want to read.

If you have any expertise that may help us, or if you have a good idea or suggestion, please let us know! And if you want to get involved, it is easy: just go to [Get involved?](#get-involved)! Also, if you want to share some idea directly to us, go to: [Contact us](#contact-us).

## Get involved

First of all, thanks for considering getting involved! It means a lot to us!

If you want to understand our project and the steps of its construction, you should go to [Roadmap][link_Roadmap]. In the Roadmap, you will see all the open issues that we still need help. Or you can also go directly to our open [issues][link_issue].

But if you really wanna know all the details of our project, go to our [Contributing Guidelines][link_Contribution]. There you will be able to find all the juicy information about Science Communication Magazine. 

Please, don't forget to reed our [Code of Conduct][link_Code]!
